# CS50x Labs
Labs are programming exercises that prepare you for the week's problem set of the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science course from Harvard University, the 2022 version of the course.

- Some lab codes have already been distributed to students, but with missing functions for us to implement.
- Each lab corresponds to a lecture.

You can find the link to the course website <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">here</a>. Partnered with edX.
